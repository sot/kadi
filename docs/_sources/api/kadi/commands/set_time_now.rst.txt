kadi.commands.set_time_now
==========================

.. py:function:: kadi.commands.set_time_now(date)

   
   Context manager to temporarily set CXOTIME_NOW to ``date``.

   This temporarily sets the CXOTIME_NOW environment variable to ``date`` within the
   context block. This is a very thin wrapper around ska_helpers.utils.temp_env_var.
   This effectively makes ``date`` serve as the current time and is useful for testing.

   In this example we get the observation history as if the 2025:012:14:37:04 SCS-107
   run never happened::

     import kadi.commands as kc
     start = "2025:012"
     stop = "2025:018"
     with kc.set_time_now(stop):
         obss_as_planned = kc.get_observations(
             start, stop, event_filter=kc.filter_scs107_events
         )

   :Parameters:

       **date** : CxoTimeLike
           Date in CxoTime-compatible format.
