kadi.commands.states.add_transition
===================================

.. py:function:: kadi.commands.states.add_transition(transitions, idx, transition)

   
   Add ``transition`` to the ``transitions`` list.

   This is done at the first appropriate place after the ``idx`` entry.

   This is typically used by dynamic transitions that are actually calling a
   function to generate downstream transitions.  The ManeuverTransition class
   is the canonical example.

   :Parameters:

       **transitions**
           global list of transition dicts

       **idx**
           current index into transitions in state processing

       **transition**
           transition to add (dict)



   :Returns:

       None
