kadi.commands.states.MechMove
=============================

.. py:class:: kadi.commands.states.MechMove

   Bases: :py:obj:`FixedTransition`


   
   Transitions for mech moves that have non-zero duration.

   This adds two transitions per matched command:
   - First one at cmd time with the transition value with ``_MOVE`` appended
   - Second one at cmd time + move_duration with the straight transition value

   This inherits from FixedTransition for the case of an attribute that gets
   set to a fixed value when the command occurs, e.g. pcad_mode='NMAN' for
   AONMMODE.

   Class attributes:

   :param transition_key: single transition key or list of transition keys
   :param transition_val: single transition value or list of values
   :param move_duration: duration of the move (astropy time Quantity)
   :param apply_move_duration: if True, apply the move duration to states
