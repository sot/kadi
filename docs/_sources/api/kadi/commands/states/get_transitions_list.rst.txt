=========================================

.. py:function:: kadi.commands.states.get_transitions_list(cmds, state_keys, start, stop, continuity=None)

   
   Get transitions for given set of ``cmds`` and ``state_keys``.

   A ``transition`` here defines a state transition.  It is a dict with a
   ``date`` key (date of transition) and key/value pairs corresponding to the
   state keys that change.

   If ``state_keys`` is None then all known state keys are included.

   :Parameters:

       **cmds**
           CmdList with spacecraft commands

       **state_keys**
           desired state keys (None, str, or list)



   :Returns:

       list of dict (transitions), set of transition classes
