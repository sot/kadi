kadi.commands.states.SunVectorTransition
========================================

.. py:class:: kadi.commands.states.SunVectorTransition

   Bases: :py:obj:`BaseTransition`


   
   Add transitions between start/stop every 10 ksec.

   This is to sample the pitch and off_nominal roll during NPNT.  These are
   function transitions which check to see that ``pcad_mode == 'NPNT'`` before
   changing the pitch / off_nominal_roll.

   .. py:method:: set_transitions(transitions_list, cmds, start, stop)
      :classmethod:


      
      Set transitions for a Table of commands ``cmds``.


      :Parameters:

          **transitions_list**
              list of transitions (updated in-place)

          **cmds**
              commands (CmdList)

          **start**
              start time for states

          **stop**
              stop time for states



      :Returns:

          None

   .. py:method:: update_sun_vector_state(date, transitions, state, idx)
      :classmethod:


      
      Transition callback method for ``pitch`` / ``off_nom_roll`` states.

      This will potentially update the ``pitch`` and ``off_nom_roll`` states if
      pcad_mode is NPNT.

      :Parameters:

          **date**
              date (str)

          **transitions**
              global list of transitions

          **state**
              current state (dict)

          **idx**
              current index into transitions
