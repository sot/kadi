kadi.commands.states.get_continuity
===================================

.. py:function:: kadi.commands.states.get_continuity(date=None, state_keys=None, lookbacks=(7, 30, 180, 1000), scenario=None)

   
   Get the state and transition dates at ``date`` for ``state_keys``.

   This function finds the state at a particular date by fetching commands
   prior to that date and determine the states.  It returns dictionary
   ``continuity`` provides the state values. Included in this dict is a special
   key ``__dates__`` which provides the corresponding date at which the
   state-changing command occurred.

   Since some state keys like ``pitch`` change often (many times per day) while
   others like ``letg`` may not change for weeks, this function does dynamic
   lookbacks from ``date`` to find transitions for each key.  By default it
   will try looking back 7 days, then 30 days, then 180 days, and finally 1000
   days.  This lookback sequence can be controlled with the ``lookbacks``
   argument.

   If ``state_keys`` is ``None`` then the default keys ``states.DEFAULT_STATE_KEYS``
   is used.  This corresponds to the "classic" Chandra commanded states (obsid,
   ACIS, PCAD, and mechanisms).

   :Parameters:

       **date**
           date (DateTime compatible, default=NOW)

       **state_keys**
           list of state keys or str (one state key) or None

       **lookbacks**
           list of lookback times in days (default=[7, 30, 180, 1000])

       **scenario**
           commands archive scenario (default=None)



   :Returns:

       dict of state values
