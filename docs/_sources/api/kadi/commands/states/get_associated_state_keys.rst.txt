kadi.commands.states.get_associated_state_keys
==============================================

.. py:function:: kadi.commands.states.get_associated_state_keys(state_keys)

   
   Return the full set of state keys that are associated with the requested keys.

   Go through each transition class which impacts desired state keys and accumulate
   all the state keys that the classes touch.  For instance if user requests
   state_keys=['q1'] then we actually need to process all the PCAD_states state keys
   and then at the end reduce down to the requested keys.
