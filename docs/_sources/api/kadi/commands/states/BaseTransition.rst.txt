   .. py:method:: __init_subclass__()
      :classmethod:



   .. py:method:: get_state_changing_commands(cmds)
      :classmethod:


      
      Get commands that match the required attributes for state changing commands.

      This depends on two class attributes that are defined in subclasses:

      ``command_attributes`` (required)
        dict of {cmd_attr: match_value, ..}, where ``cmd_attr`` is either ``type``
        or ``tlmsid``, and ``match_value`` is the required value.

      ``command_params`` (optional)
        dict of {cmd_attr: match_value, ..}, where ``cmd_attr`` is one of the
        available command parameters, and ``match_value`` is either the required value
        or a list of required values (where at least one must match).

      :Parameters:

          **cmds** : CommandTable
              Input commands



      :Returns:

          CommandTable
              Subset of ``cmds`` relevant for this Transition class
