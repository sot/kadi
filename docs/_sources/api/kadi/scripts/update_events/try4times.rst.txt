kadi.scripts.update_events.try4times
====================================

.. py:function:: kadi.scripts.update_events.try4times(func, *arg, **kwarg)

   
   Work around problems with sqlite3 database getting locked out from writing

   This is presumably due to read activity.  Not completely understood.

   This function will try to run ``func(*arg, **kwarg)`` a total of 4 times with an
   increasing sequence of wait times between tries.  It catches only a database
   locked error.
