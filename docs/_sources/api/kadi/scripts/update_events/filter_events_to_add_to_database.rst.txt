kadi.scripts.update_events.filter_events_to_add_to_database
===========================================================

.. py:function:: kadi.scripts.update_events.filter_events_to_add_to_database(EventModel, cls_name, events_in_dates)

   
   Filter events to add to the database.

   This takes a list of events (dicts) and returns those that are not already in the
   database.  This is done by checking the primary key of the event model or else
   (for telemetry events) by checking if the start time of the new event is close to
   that of an existing event.

   :Parameters:

       **EventModel** : class
           Event model class to update (e.g. models.DsnComm)

       **cls_name** : str
           Event model class name

       **events_in_dates** : list of dict
           List of event dictionaries



   :Returns:

       **event_models** : list of EventModel
           List of event model instances to save

       **events** : list of dict
           List of event dictionaries (filtered from original)
