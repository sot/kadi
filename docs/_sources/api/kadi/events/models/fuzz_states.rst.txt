kadi.events.models.fuzz_states
==============================

.. py:function:: kadi.events.models.fuzz_states(states, t_fuzz)

   
   For a set of `states` (from fetch.MSID.state_intervals()) or intervals (from
   fetch.MSID.logical_intervals), merge any that are within `t_fuzz` seconds of each
   other.  Logical intervals are just the subset of states with 'val' equal to a
   particular value.


   :Parameters:

       **states**
           table of states or intervals

       **t_fuzz** : fuzz time in seconds
           :returns fuzzed_states: table
