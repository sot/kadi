   .. py:method:: select_overlapping(query_event, allow_partial=True)

      
      Select events which overlap with the specified ``query_event``.

      By default partial overlap between the self events and the ``query_event``
      intervals is sufficient.  However, if ``allow_partial=False``, then
      complete overlap is required.  As an example this would be selecting
      maneuvers that are *entirely* within the radiation zone.

      Examples::

        >>> from kadi import events
        >>> manvrs = events.manvrs.filter('2001:001:00:00:00', '2001:003:00:00:00')
        >>> non_rad_manvrs = manvrs.select_overlapping(~events.rad_zones)
        >>> rad_manvrs = manvrs.select_overlapping(events.rad_zones)
        >>> fully_radzone_manvrs = manvrs.select_overlapping(events.rad_zones,
        ...                                                  allow_partial=False)

      :param query_event: QueryEvent object (e.g. events.tsc_moves or a composite
                          boolean expression)
      :param allow_partial: return events where there is at least partial overlap
                      (default=True)

      :returns: list of overlapping events
