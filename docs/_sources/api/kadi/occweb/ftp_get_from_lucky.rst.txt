kadi.occweb.ftp_get_from_lucky
==============================

.. py:function:: kadi.occweb.ftp_get_from_lucky(ftp_dirname, local_files, user=None, logger=None)

   
   Get files from lucky.

   This looks in remote ``ftp_dirname`` for files that have basenames matching those of
   ``local_files``.  The remote files are copied to the corresponding local_files
   names.  This is the converse of ftp_put_to_lucky and thus requires unique basenames
   for all files.
