kadi.occweb.ftp_put_to_lucky
============================

.. py:function:: kadi.occweb.ftp_put_to_lucky(ftp_dirname, local_files, user=None, logger=None)

   
   Put the ``local_files`` onto lucky in /``user``/``ftp_dirname``.

   First put it at the top level, then when complete move it into a subdir
   eng_archive.  This lets the OCC side just watch for fully-uploaded files in
   that directory.

   The directory paths of ``local_files`` are stripped off so they all wind up
   in a flat structure within ``ftp_dirname``.
