kadi.occweb.get_occweb_page
===========================

.. py:function:: kadi.occweb.get_occweb_page(path, timeout=30, cache=False, binary=False, user=None, password=None)

   
   Get contents of ``path`` on OCCweb.

   This returns the contents of the OCCweb page at ``path`` where it assumed
   that ``path`` is either a URL (which starts with 'https://occweb') or a
   relative path::

     https://occweb.cfa.harvard.edu/occweb/<path>

   In addition ``path`` can be a file or directory path starting with one of
   the following Noodle directory paths. These get translated to an equivalent
   location on OCCweb::

     \\noodle\FOT
     \\noodle\GRETA\mission\Backstop
     \\noodle\vweb

   If ``user`` and ``password`` are not provided then it is required that
   credentials are stored in the file ``~/.netrc``. See the ``ska_ftp`` package
   for details.

   If the page is not found then a ``requests.exceptions.HTTPError`` is raised.

   :param timeout: int

   :param cache: bool

   :param password: str, optional
