# Data files and directories.  The *_dir vars can have $ENV{} vars which
# get interpolated.  (Note lack of task name after TST_DATA because this is just for test).

data_dir     $ENV{SKA_DATA}/kadi       # Data file directory
log_dir      $ENV{SKA_DATA}/kadi/logs  # Log file directory
bin_dir      $ENV{SKA_SHARE}/kadi      # Bin dir (optional, see task def'n)

# Email addresses that receive an alert if there was a severe error in
# running jobs (i.e. couldn't start jobs or couldn't open log file).
# Processing errors *within* the jobs are caught with watch_cron_logs

alert       SOT

# Define task parameters
#  cron: Job repetition specification ala crontab
#  exec: Name of executable.  Can have $ENV{} vars which get interpolated.
#        If bin_dir is defined then bin_dir is prepended to non-absolute exec names.
#  log: Name of log.  Can have $ENV{} vars which get interpolated.
#        If log is set to '' then no log file will be created
#        If log is not defined it is set to <task_name>.log.
#        If log_dir is defined then log_dir is prepended to non-absolute log names.
#  timeout: Maximum time (seconds) for job before timing out

# This has multiple jobs which get run in specified order
# Note the syntax 'exec <number> : cmd', which means that the given command is
# executed only once for each <number> of times the task is executed.  In the
# example below, the commands are done once each 1, 2, and 4 minutes, respectively.
